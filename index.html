        <h2>Cohorts vs. Conferences?</h2>
        <p>Conferences are great! They bring ideas, excitement, and inspiration to church staff and lay-leaders. But what happens when the excitement dies down and leaders return to their churches to implement changes? That is when encouragement, coaching, and focus are needed most. It's incredilby difficult to make the necessary cultural changes alone. Cohorts focus on building on-going relationships, not plug-n-play plans. They provide a journey of discovery, encouragement, and mutual development. Developing a culture of disciplemaking is far more effective through the cohort model. Join us!</p>

      <div class="content">
        <h2>An Overview</h2>
        <p>The first and most critical step in the cohort is developing relationships. The Cohorts begin by traveling to Minneapolis together. After two days of learning, sharing, eating, and drinking, we will reconvene virtually every month. Our virtual time will be dynamic. It won't be a one way monologue. Training requires conversation, breakout groups, and lots of interaction with each another's ideas. Thanks to modern technology all of that can be done through video conferencing. The year will conclude with a 3 day gathering in Hunt, TX. We will complete our modules, make plans for the future, shoot guns, sit around a firepit, smoke cigars, and play a lot of pickleball.</p>

        <h2>Ryan MacDiarmid</h2>
        <p>Ryan is the lead pastor of
          <a href="https://www.creeksideonline.com">Creekside Church</a>
          in Rocklin, CA. Over the past 5 years, Creekside has transitioned from a traditional small group modeled church to a missional community model. The transition required strategic shifts in training and equiping lay-leaders for ministry. They have also implemented replicating disciple-making systems for the men and women of their church through a program called TWELVE. Ryan found tremendous support and encouragement through the EFCA cohorts and is excited to carry them on to more pastors who desire new and more effective systems for disciple-making. Ryan also founded (with Mark Beuving) and regularly contributes to the blog <a href="https://www.jackasstheology.com">jackasstheology.com</a>
